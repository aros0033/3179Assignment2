    <p>As expected the majority of health expenditure is funded by government entities (State and territory + Australian Government),
      <br>with 73% of all funds originating from government entities in 2021.
      <br><br> From 2011-2021 the predominant areas of spending have consistently been primary health care, public hospital services and referred medical services
      <br> with an uptick seen in 2020, in line with the global pandemic.
